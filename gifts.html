            <section>
                <p>In 2021 we will have been in a relationship for twelve years, and will have lived together for four.</p>
                <p>While we greatly appreciate the thought, sentiment, and tradition which goes into wedding gifts, we feel as though there is nothing we can truly say that we need.</p>
                <p>Instead, we ask that those who would like to send a gift consider doing so by way of a donation to charity or similar.</p>
                <p>Listed below are some example charities which are close to our hearts.</p>
